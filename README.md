# SYTHETIC-DATA-GENERATION-USING-GAN-S
"Engineered a privacy-preserving Generative AI solution using CTGAN/WGAN to synthesize high-fidelity operational data for SCADA systems, enabling robust anomaly detection research."
Synthetic Data Generation for SCADA Systems (CTGAN/WGAN)
This project solves the challenge of generating high-fidelity, production-ready data for security analysis when real operational data is too sensitive to share.

1. Problem Statement 
Critical infrastructure, managed by SCADA systems, produces highly sensitive data required for cybersecurity research and anomaly detection model training. Due to stringent operational privacy and national security concerns, this data cannot be shared publicly. This creates a severe research bottleneck, as developers lack the large, diverse, and realistic datasets needed to build and validate new security products.

2. Technical Solution 
We engineered a sophisticated deep generative model combining CTGAN (Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network) and WGAN (Wasserstein GAN) architectures. This model learns the complex multivariate statistical and temporal dependencies within SCADA data, allowing it to produce large volumes of synthetic data that accurately mimics the real system's behavior, thereby ensuring high fidelity without compromising privacy.

3. Business Case 
The solution enables risk mitigation and product commercialization. By generating safe, non-sensitive data, the project allows security firms, external researchers, and internal teams to develop and rigorously test high-accuracy anomaly detection models against realistic scenarios. This accelerates the development of commercial cybersecurity products and improves infrastructure resilien
