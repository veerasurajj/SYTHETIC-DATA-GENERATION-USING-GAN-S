# SYTHETIC-DATA-GENERATION-USING-GAN-S
"Engineered a privacy-preserving Generative AI solution using CTGAN/WGAN to synthesize high-fidelity operational data for SCADA systems, enabling robust anomaly detection research."
Project Name	Synthetic Numeric Data Generation for SCADA Systems (CTGAN/WGAN)
Problem Statement	Critical scarcity of real SCADA data due to stringent operational privacy and security concerns. This restricts researchers and AI developers from accessing datasets needed to train robust anomaly detection models and conduct cybersecurity analysis.
Technical Solution	Engineered a deep generative model using CTGAN and WGAN architectures to produce high-fidelity synthetic data that mimics the statistical and temporal dependencies of real SCADA data.
Business Case	Enables risk mitigation and product commercialization. Allows security firms and internal teams to develop and rigorously test high-accuracy anomaly detection models against realistic scenarios while maintaining regulatory compliance.
Code Confirmation	The uploaded CTGAN.ipynb confirms the implementation of: Pandas/NumPy for data handling, MinMaxScaler for normalization, CTGAN for baseline synthetic generation, and a custom WGAN implementation using PyTorch (torch) classes (Generator, Discriminator) and RMSprop optimization.
